# `Ghost Messages`
                   

 
        
The application is designed to display a message after providing an ID and password, and then delete it immediately after reading.
If you want to quickly share a key, password, hash, or data regarding a port, configuration, number, or code, GhostMessages is for you. Thanks to messages that disappear like a ghost after being read, you can rest assured that no history will be left behind, and by going through consensus, the record will be deleted from all replicas

----------------------------------------!!!
Tip: If you plan to set such a message for a longer period, for example, someone will be able to read it in a few hours, consider using a stronger password. Good practice suggests a password of at least 14 characters, including a special character like !@#$%^&* and a number

What is this application for ?
The Ghost Messages application was created to generate self-destructing messages. You set a password and enter the message content, after which you receive an ID. You can give this ID and password to someone. After the message is read, it will be deleted, meaning the reader can only view it once

How long will my message be stored ?
Until someone reads it using the ID and password. After the message is read, its content is permanently deleted

What can I use this for?
For anything you need to share without leaving a trace. Do you need to send someone a bank account number and donâ€™t want to leave a trace in an email or on Facebook? Do you need to send someone a software key or confidential information? Ghost Messages is made for that. The application runs on the ICP blockchain, which makes it independent from centralized entities

To read the message, if you already have the ID and password, go to 'Read Message', the green button on the top black bar, and enter the message ID and password in the respective fields, then press the blue 'Show Message' button. The message you read will be deleted immediately after you display it, so you will only be able to see it once. The ID is numerical; note that there are no spaces at the beginning or end of the ID. The password can be anything. You can copy the message using the green 'Copy' button
