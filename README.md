# `Ghost Messages` 👻

https://ghostmessages.ink 🔗

The **Ghost Messages**  application is designed to display a message after providing an ID and password, and then delete it immediately after being read. If you need to quickly share a key, password, hash, or data regarding a port, configuration, number, or code, GhostMessages is perfect for you. Thanks to its self-destructing messages, you can be sure that no history is left behind. Once a message is read, it’s deleted across all replicas thanks to consensus.

### Tip: 👾
If you plan to keep the message available for a longer period (e.g., someone will read it in a few hours), consider using a stronger password. **Best practice** suggests using a password with **at least 14 characters**, including a **special character** (like `!@#$%^&*`) and a **number**.

## What is this application for ? ❔
The Ghost Messages application allows you to create **self-destructing messages**. You set a password and enter the message content, then receive an ID. This ID, along with the password, can be shared with someone. Once the message is read, it’s permanently deleted, allowing the recipient to view it only once.

---

## How long will my message be stored? ❔
Your message will be stored until it is read using the ID and password. After the message is read, it is **permanently deleted**.

---

## What can I use this for? ❔
Use Ghost Messages for anything you need to share **without leaving a trace**. Whether you need to send a bank account number, software key, or other confidential information without leaving a digital footprint, Ghost Messages is ideal. Running on the **ICP blockchain**, the app operates independently from centralized entities, enhancing privacy and security.
